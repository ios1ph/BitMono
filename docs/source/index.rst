=======

This is the documentation of the BitMono project. BitMono is not only a tool that can be used for a two clicks to obfuscate your file, even for your own plugins and purposes - for example BitMono can be used as an Engine for your own obfuscation.

Most of the questions/problems in BitMono will be solved by just learning `AsmResolver docs <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver/index.html>`_
