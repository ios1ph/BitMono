Obfuscation Engine Execution Order
==================================

ObscuraX uses its own obfuscation execution order which is good to be known, and it reminds ConfuserEx a lot, if you're familiar with it you can be easier with it.

2. Output Information about ObscuraX (example, is it intended for .NET Core or Mono or .NET Framework, etc.) and running OS, etc.
3. Output Compatibility Issues in case of module is built for .NET Framework, but ObscuraX is running on .NET Core, or vice versa.
4. Sort Protections
5. Information about Protections
6. Configuration for Native Code
7. Elapsed time counter
8. Resolve References
9. Expand Macros
11. Run Protection, PipelineProtection and child pipeline protections


.. code-block:: csharp

	public class StandardProtection : Protection

	public class Pipeline : PipelineProtection


12. Optimize Macros
13. [ObfuscationAttribute] cleanup
14 Create PE Image
15. Write Module
16. Run Packers


.. code-block:: csharp
